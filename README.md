Project Name: API Wonderland

Description:

I’m excited to share my latest project, API Wonderland, a fun and interactive web application that pulls random data from various APIs to brighten your day! 🌟

With API Wonderland, you can enjoy a mix of:

Random Cat Facts 🐱
Random Dog Pics 🐶
Random Fox Images 🦊
Random Jokes 😂
Number Facts 🔢
For this project, I used HTML and CSS for the frontend design and JavaScript to handle the backend API calls. The goal was to create a seamless user experience while exploring API integration and enhancing my frontend skills.

It was a fantastic learning experience, and I’m excited to keep building on it!
